# BYOB ONE — Dual Operational Layers

Where Zero provides the preparedness, One builds the operational system.

A system built on two layers:

T — Train (Testnet)

M — Money (Mainnet)

Same architecture.

Different economic gravity.

---

## ONE-T Layer — Train / Test

Purpose:
Skill development
Peer-to-peer experimentation
Transaction rehearsal
Psychological onboarding
Important clarification:
This is not just “developer sandbox.”
The T layer has already demonstrated:
Permissionless peer-to-peer transfers
Real wallet-to-wallet flow
Real network propagation
Real settlement mechanics
The rules are real.
The tokens just aren’t scarce.
T builds competence without consequence.

---

## ONE-M Layer — Money

Layer M is both:

Store of Value (SOV)

Medium of Exchange (MOE)

Both functions are available.

Because:
The tools are already built
The transaction flow already tested
The signing flow already proven
The UX already trained on T

So when switching from T to M:
Nothing changes architecturally.
Only value density changes.

Architectural Symmetry

Economic Weight
Purpose
ZERO
Mainnet
0 sats

Identity & Legitimacy
T
Testnet
Non-scarce
Training & P2P practice
M
Mainnet
Scarce
SOV + MOE

The protocol doesn’t change. The competence transfers. The sovereignty remains constant.

Most systems:
Introduce money first
Then teach competence

BYOB:
Establishes legitimacy (ZERO)
Builds competence (T)
Enables value (M)
This reverses the risk curve.

The Subtle Advantage

Because T already enabled real peer-to-peer transfers:
Switching to M is not a leap.
It’s simply:
Test tokens to scarce tokens
Practice to consequence
Rehearsal to reality

No new rules. Just toggle the button.
