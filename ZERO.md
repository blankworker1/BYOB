# BYOB Zero In Plain English


**What Is BYOB Zero?**

BYOB Zero is a way to create a Bitcoin wallet
without an account,
without registration,
and without asking anyone for permission.
The wallet does not live on a phone.
It does not live on a server.
It lives in your memory.


**Why “Zero”?**

Zero cost.
Zero risk.
Zero central control.
Zero personal data.
You create the structure now.
You can add money later — or never.


**The Core Idea**

Your wallet comes from:
1. A public wall
2. A private pattern
The wall is public.
The pattern is secret.
That is all.


**What Is a “Seed”?**

A seed is the secret recipe of your wallet.
It is a list of words.
From those words, Bitcoin software can rebuild:
All your addresses
All your balances
All your future addresses
Everything.
If someone knows your seed, they control your wallet.
If only you know it, only you control it.


**Why Words?**

Computers use numbers.
But very large numbers are hard for humans to remember.
So Bitcoin turns one very large secret number
into a list of simple words.
Those words are easier to:
Read
Write
Speak
Remember
But they still represent a very large secret number.


**What Makes It Powerful?**

Your 12 words are not random poetry.
They are:
A very large secret number
Converted into human language
Recognized by Bitcoin everywhere in the world
Any compatible wallet
can rebuild your wallet
from those same words.


**How BYOB Zero Uses the Seed**

With BYOB Zero you do not randomly generate words.

You select them using:
A public Word Wall
A private pattern
The 12th word is calculated automatically
to make the seed valid.
Then you add a passphrase.
This makes your wallet uniqueneven if someone else somehow used the same 12 words.

**Simple Way to Explain It**

Seed = the master key.
Words = human version of a secret number.
Passphrase = an extra lock on the master key.
Why This Is Important
No company stores your seed.
No email recovers it.
No “forgot password” exists.
If you remember it correctly,
your wallet lives.
If you lose it,
the wallet is gone forever.
That is power.
And responsibility.

The Public Word Wall contains all 2048 standard Bitcoin words.
Everyone can see it.
Everyone can use it.
It is not secret.
It is like a public library of words.

Your Private Pattern
You choose:
One sheet
One starting cell
One simple pattern (line, L-shape, stairs)
That pattern selects 11 words.
Then:
You select four specific cells
One on each of four sheets
These become your passphrase words
You remember positions.
Not the words.
No one else knows your pattern.

The Device you use is a SeedSigner.
SeedSigner is:
Offline
Stateless
Temporary
It does not store your seed.
When you turn it off, it forgets everything.

You enter:
Your 11 words
The device calculates the 12th word
You enter your 4 passphrase words
The device shows:
A wallet fingerprint
A receive address
You take only the public information.

The Artifact you create a simple image:
QR code (public receive address)
Wallet fingerprint
This can be uploaded to the public ledger.
Only public data is shared.
Your private pattern stays in your mind.


**What Is Private?**

Your privacy depends on remembering:
Your starting position
Your pattern
Your passphrase positions
The sheet order
Do not store these online.
Do not write them with the words.
Remember the movement.
Remember the shape.


**What Is Public?**

Public information is safe to share:
The Word Wall
The community label
The QR receive address
The wallet fingerprint
The wallet number
Public does not reveal your seed.

**Why This Matters**

Most wallets depend on:
Apps
Accounts
Devices
Companies

BYOB Zero depends on:
A public wall
Your memory
A simple offline device
If everything digital disappears,
your wallet can still be rebuilt.

**What You Leave With**

At the end of BYOB Zero workshop you have:
A working Bitcoin wallet
A public address
A way to verify it
No exposure of private keys
No central issuer
No registration
You created a wallet from structure and memory.

**One Sentence Summary**

BYOB is the bank with no money.

A bank account that exists only in your mind.

Zero cost. Zero risk.

No permission required.

"A bank with no money cannot be robbed, but it can teach you how banks work."
