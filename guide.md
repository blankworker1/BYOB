## Introduction

BYOB (**Become Your Own Bank**) is an educational project for managing and visualizing cryptographic assets safely.  
This guide helps you navigate the tools, understand how to participate, and generate posters.

## GENERATOR

The **GENERATOR** page lets you:

- Generate a five separate poster image files, using a four character code (Wall ID) and date as a seed, to randomize the layout of the 2048 BIP-39 seed words.
- Copy the image files to clipboard.
- Download five A1 size poster image files for printing.

### Steps:

1. Enter your **Wall ID** (max 4 characters).
2. Click **Generate Seed**.
3. Copy your seed or download the posters.

## WORDWALL Posters

The **posters** are multi-page sheets:

- Each page has a numbered grid of words.
- The bottom-right cell always shows your Wall ID.
- Certain columns are reserved (98–100) for security and formatting.

## Safety Notes

- BYOB is **not a bank** and holds **no funds**.
- You can share the WORDWALL publicly as it contains no sensitive info.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use the same name twice?**  
A: Yes, the generator is deterministic, but seeds will be the same if the name and date match.

**Q: Can I edit the poster after download?**  
A: You can annotate manually, but changing BIP39 words breaks determinism.
